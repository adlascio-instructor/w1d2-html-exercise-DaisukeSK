<p>
    This is an expermental web page to learn how each HTML element works.
    <br/>
    What we are supposed to do is making 2 HTML files named index.html where you are now and contact.html, 
    and a folder named files in current directory.
    Inside a folder, we make another HTML file named images.html and 2 image files of our choice. 
    These 2 images need to be read in images.html and shown on browser.
    <br/>
    Each HTML file needs to have links to the other 2 files and one or more paragraph elements in them.
    <br/>
    As for contact.html, it should include information like LinkedIn, e-mail address and phone number.
